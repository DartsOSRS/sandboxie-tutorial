# Sandboxie Tutorial
We'll be using the open-source program [Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie) in order to run multiple instances of the Jagex Launcher, each with their own settings and accounts saved. This allows us to run both Jagex Accounts and non-Jagex Accounts through the Jagex Launcher, and allows us to bypass the 20-account limit.

### Step 1: Download & Install Sandboxie Classic or Plus.
We'll be using Sandboxie Plus for this tutorial.

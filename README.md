# Sandboxie Tutorial
We'll be using the open-source program [Sandboxie](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie) in order to run multiple instances of the Jagex Launcher, each with their own settings and accounts saved. This allows us to run both Jagex Accounts and non-Jagex Accounts through the Jagex Launcher, and allows us to bypass the 20-account limit.

### Step 1: Download & Install Sandboxie Classic or Plus
We'll be using Sandboxie Plus for this tutorial. You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/releases/latest).

### Step 2: Box Options
Right click DefaultBox and select **Sandbox Options**.

These are the settings I use (optional):

Under Run Menu, click the dropdown arrow next to the 'Add program' button, and select your Jagex Launcher. For me this was under 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Jagex Launcher\JagexLauncher.exe'.

### Step 3: Run the Jagex Launcher with Sandboxie
Right click DefaultBox and select the Jagex Launcher you added under 'Run'.

### Step 4: Update Jagex Launcher settings
You should now have a sandboxed instance of the Jagex Launcher running. Sign out of your accounts if they're already saved, and re-add the account(s) you'd like to the sandboxed launcher.

### Step 5: Allow processes
You should see a notification pop up asking if you'd like to allow the files to be copied. Select 'Yes' for all of them as they pop up.

### Step 6: Run your clients
Congratulations! You should now have an instanced version of the Jagex Launcher running alongside your regular one. If you'd like to add even more Jagex Launcher instances, you can create a new Box and follow the same steps.
